How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's simple, it shows the difference betwen the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You are able to see what have changed, and can get some ideas back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saves may avoid you to lose you file in an accident like power fail.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    becouse they are built to control projects that normaly have multiple files
    and the others like Docs is designed to treat single files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows a preview of what has been changed and git diff shows what actually has changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know that you can get the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I wanna use it to control all my dev projects
